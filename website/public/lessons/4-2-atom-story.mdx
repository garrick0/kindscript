# Adding Stories

Every good component has Storybook stories. Our Button has one:

```
Button/
└── v1.0.0/
    ├── Button.tsx             ← source
    └── Button.stories.tsx     ← stories
```

Let's add this to our model.

## What changed in `src/context.ts`?

We added a new leaf Kind:

```ts
type AtomStory = Kind<"AtomStory">;
```

And a second member to `ButtonComponent`:

```ts
type ButtonComponent = Kind<"ButtonComponent", {
  source: [AtomSource, './v1.0.0/Button.tsx'];
  story:  [AtomStory,  './v1.0.0/Button.stories.tsx'];
}>;
```

The instance now declares both members:

```ts
export const button = {
  source: {},
  story: {},
} satisfies Instance<ButtonComponent, '.'>;
```

## Run the check

```
npx ksc check .
```

**0 violations.** Both files exist at their declared locations.

:::info
Notice that `Button.stories.tsx` imports from `./Button`. That's fine — we haven't declared any constraints yet. KindScript only checks rules you explicitly define.
