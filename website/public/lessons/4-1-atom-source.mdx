# Modeling a Component

Your design system has Button components organized in versioned folders:

```
Button/
└── v1.0.0/
    └── Button.tsx       ← the component source
```

Let's use KindScript to model this structure. We'll start with the simplest piece: the component source file.

## What's in `src/context.ts`?

Open `src/context.ts`. It defines two kinds:

```ts
type AtomSource = Kind<"AtomSource">;
```

`AtomSource` is a **leaf Kind** — it has no members. It represents a single `.tsx` file that defines a UI component.

```ts
type ButtonComponent = Kind<"ButtonComponent", {
  source: [AtomSource, './v1.0.0/Button.tsx'];
}>;
```

`ButtonComponent` is a **composite Kind** with one member called `source`. The tuple `[AtomSource, './v1.0.0/Button.tsx']` means: "the `source` member is an `AtomSource` located at `./v1.0.0/Button.tsx` relative to the instance root."

Finally, the instance declaration:

```ts
export const button = {
  source: {},
} satisfies Instance<ButtonComponent, '.'>;
```

`'.'` is the instance root — the directory containing `context.ts` (i.e. `src/`). So `source` resolves to `src/v1.0.0/Button.tsx`.

## Run the check

```
npx ksc check .
```

KindScript validates that the structure matches the declaration. **0 violations** — the file exists where we said it would.
