# Adding Molecule Stories

Our Card has Storybook stories that demonstrate its variants:

```
Card/
└── v1.0.0/
    ├── Card.tsx             ← source
    └── Card.stories.tsx     ← stories
```

## What changed in `src/context.ts`?

We added `MoleculeStory` as a second leaf Kind and a second member:

```ts
type MoleculeStory = Kind<"MoleculeStory">;

type CardComponent = Kind<"CardComponent", {
  source: [MoleculeSource, './v1.0.0/Card.tsx'];
  story:  [MoleculeStory,  './v1.0.0/Card.stories.tsx'];
}>;
```

The stories file imports from the source to render Card in each story. That import relationship is what KindScript can enforce.
