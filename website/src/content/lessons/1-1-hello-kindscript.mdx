# Hello KindScript

KindScript enforces architectural rules at compile time. You define your architecture as TypeScript types, and KindScript checks that your code follows the rules.

Let's start with a clean project that uses **Clean Architecture** with three layers:

- **Domain** — business logic (innermost)
- **Application** — orchestration
- **Infrastructure** — external I/O (outermost)

## What's in `src/context.ts`?

Open `src/context.ts` in the editor. This file defines the architecture:

1. **Kind types** declare each layer (`DomainLayer`, `ApplicationLayer`, `InfrastructureLayer`)
2. **Members with locations** map each layer to a folder using tuple syntax: `[Kind, './path']`
3. **Constraints** forbid imports from domain into infrastructure or application
4. **Instance** declares this as a live instance of the architecture

All APIs are pure types — zero runtime footprint.

## Run the check

In the terminal, run:

```
npx ksc check .
```

You should see **0 violations** — this project follows all the rules.

:::tip
`ksc` is the KindScript CLI. `check .` checks the current directory for architectural violations.
