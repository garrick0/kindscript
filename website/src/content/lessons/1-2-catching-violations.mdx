# Catching Violations

Now let's see what happens when code breaks the architectural rules.

## The violation

Look at `src/domain/user.ts` in the editor. Notice the problem:

```ts
import { saveUser } from '../infrastructure/user-repo';
```

The **domain** layer is importing from **infrastructure**. Our `noDependency` constraint forbids exactly this.

## See the error

Run the check:

```
npx ksc check .
```

You'll see a **KS70001** error — a forbidden dependency violation. The error shows:
- Which file has the bad import
- Which import path is forbidden
- Which contract caught it

:::info
`noDependency` is the most common constraint. It enforces the dependency rule: inner layers must not know about outer layers.
