# 7. Flatten `src/runtime/`

Date: 2026-02-08
Status: Done

**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Status:** Done

### Context

`src/runtime/` contained ~65 lines of type-only exports (`Kind`, `Constraints`, `MemberMap`, `Instance`). The name "runtime" was a leftover from when it contained actual runtime functions (`locate()`, `defineContracts()`).

### Decision

Move all types to `src/types/index.ts`. Delete `src/runtime/`.

### Rationale

- ~65 lines of type-only code doesn't need its own directory
- The name "runtime" contradicted KindScript's "zero runtime footprint" value proposition
- Research across 14 tools (Zod, Vite, Rollup, ESLint, etc.) showed no tool separates user-facing types into a subfolder
