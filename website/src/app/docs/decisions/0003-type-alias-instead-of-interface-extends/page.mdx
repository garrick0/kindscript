# 3. Type Alias Instead of `interface extends`

### Context

Kind definitions originally used `interface X extends Kind<"X"> { members }`.

### Decision

Change to `type X = Kind<"X", { members }, { constraints }>`.

### Rationale

- Eliminated redundant name (`interface DomainLayer extends Kind<"DomainLayer">`)
- No empty `{}` for leaf kinds (`type DomainLayer = Kind<"DomainLayer">`)
- Constraints as 3rd type parameter is cleaner than `extends Kind` plus separate `defineContracts()`
- `extends` implied OOP inheritance; `type` is a pure type-level concept
- All three pieces of a Kind (name, members, constraints) live in one declaration
