# 6. Remove Standard Library Packages

Date: 2026-02-07
Status: Done

**Status:** Done

### Context

KindScript originally planned to ship pre-built architectural patterns as `@kindscript/*` npm packages (`@kindscript/clean-architecture`, `@kindscript/hexagonal`, etc.).

### Decision

Remove standard library packages. Users define patterns inline in their own `.ts` files.

### Rationale

- Added complexity (package resolution service, config plumbing, branching codegen logic, extra test fixtures)
- Marginal value — defining a Kind type is ~10 lines of code
- Premature optimization — the user base doesn't exist yet to justify pre-built patterns
- Patterns defined inline are easier to customize and understand
