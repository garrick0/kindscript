# KindScript Documentation

## Chapters

| # | Chapter | What's in it |
|---|---------|-------------|

## Working Documents Convention

Active design explorations and scratch documents live in `.working/` at the project root (gitignored — not checked in). This keeps the committed `docs/` directory clean and authoritative.

**Lifecycle:**
1. Create a working document in `.working/` for design exploration
2. When the exploration is complete, uplift the relevant findings into the appropriate `docs/` chapter
3. Archive the working document by moving it to `.working/archive/`

**Key rule:** `.working/` documents are never the source of truth. If something is decided, it must be reflected in the `docs/` chapter files. Working documents are disposable scratchpads.

## Contributing

- **Update chapter files** when architectural decisions or constraints change
- **Add new ADRs** by copying `decisions/template.md` to a new numbered file
- **Use `.working/`** for design explorations (not checked in)
- **Uplift findings** from `.working/` into chapters when done, then archive the working doc
- **Update this README** if chapters are added or reorganized
