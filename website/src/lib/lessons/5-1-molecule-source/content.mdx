# Modeling a Molecule

In Atomic Design, **molecules** are groups of atoms working together. A Card molecule composes simpler elements (titles, content areas, footers) into a reusable unit.

The folder structure is identical to atoms:

```
Card/
└── v1.0.0/
    └── Card.tsx       ← the molecule source
```

## What's in `src/context.ts`?

We define `MoleculeSource` as a leaf Kind — the same pattern as `AtomSource`, but for molecules:

```ts
type MoleculeSource = Kind<"MoleculeSource">;
```

And a composite Kind that instances it:

```ts
type CardComponent = Kind<"CardComponent", {
  source: [MoleculeSource, './v1.0.0/Card.tsx'];
}>;
```

## Run the check

```
npx ksc check .
```

**0 violations.** The molecule source file exists at the declared location.

Molecules follow the same versioned folder pattern as atoms. The Kind hierarchy will mirror what we built for Button.
