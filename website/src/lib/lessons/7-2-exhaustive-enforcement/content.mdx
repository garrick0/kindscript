# Exhaustive Enforcement

By default, KindScript only checks files that belong to a member. Files outside any member's scope are **invisible** — no rules apply to them. This means developers can accidentally add code that escapes enforcement.

The `exhaustive` constraint catches this.

## The Setup

Look at `src/context.ts`. The `App` Kind has one member (`core` at `./core`) and `exhaustive: true`:

```typescript
type App = Kind<"App", {
  core: [Core, './core'];
}, {
  exhaustive: true;
}>;
```

This means: **every source file in the instance scope must belong to a member.**

## The Violation

Look at `src/helpers.ts`. It's a utility file at the project root — outside the `core/` directory. No member claims it.

Run `npx ksc check .` to see the error.

You should see error **KS70007** — unassigned code detected. KindScript found a file that doesn't belong to any member.

## Fix It

Edit `src/context.ts` to add a `helpers` member that maps to `./helpers.ts`:

```typescript
type Helpers = Kind<"Helpers">;

type App = Kind<"App", {
  core: [Core, './core'];
  helpers: [Helpers, './helpers.ts'];
}, {
  exhaustive: true;
}>;
```

Don't forget to add `helpers: {}` to the instance object too.

Run `npx ksc check .` to verify.

:::tip
Use `exhaustive: true` when you want to guarantee that **no code escapes architectural enforcement**. It's especially valuable on teams where new developers might add files in unexpected locations.
