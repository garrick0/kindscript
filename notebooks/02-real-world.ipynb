The path works like a TypeScript import — relative to the file that declares it.\n\n### Shared vs per-instance constraints\n\nConstraints on the Kind type apply to **all** instances. Same Kind = same rules. If you need different rules per context, use separate Kind types.\n\n### Cross-context dependencies\n\nKindScript's constraints operate *within* a bounded context (e.g., payments.domain can't import from payments.infrastructure). Cross-context dependencies (payments importing from orders) aren't currently expressible. You'd need a higher-level Kind with bounded contexts as members."

Define the Kind type once, create a definition file per context. `Instance<T, '.'>` resolves to each file's own directory, so the same Kind maps to different locations automatically.\n\n**Next:** See [03-typekind.ipynb](03-typekind.ipynb) for declaration-level enforcement, or [docs/06-tutorial.md](../docs/06-tutorial.md) for a complete static walkthrough including real-world design system modeling."
